== ABOUT ==
The FEMTO apache module serves queries on indexes in the /femto/
directory on the webserver. Supported are described in src/main/femto.h,
and a query is sent as a POST request.

This package also includes a demonstration javascript and SVG based
visualization tool, in femto.xhtml.

== DEPENDENCIES ==

This Apache module has been tested with Apache httpd 2.2.16.

== BUILDING ==
We have built it with an installation from source of httpd. There
have been some problems where the mod_femto finds the wrong apr
headers; we reccomend on Fedora systems to remove the apr-devel
package before installing apache httpd from source.

== INSTALLING ==
As root (or someone who can write to your Apache http directories)
run:
 make apxs-install

Create a directory femto in your htdocs (ie /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/femto).
Copy femto-js to that directory (/htdocs, not /htdocs/femto).
Next, set up a MatchAlias to
redirect /femto/index_name/viz to viz.xhtml by adding the following
to your httpd.conf file (possibly next to other ScriptAlias commands):
    <IfModule femto_module>
     <IfModule alias_module>
       AliasMatch ^/femto/(.*)/femto-js/(.*)$ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/femto-js/$2
       AliasMatch ^/femto/(.*)/index.html$ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/femto-js/viz.html
     </IfModule>
   </IfModule>

Be sure to set the path appropriately (ie replace 
/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/femto-js/ with the full path to your
copied femto-js directory).

Finally, copy (or possibly link) a FEMTO index into the femto directory;
in the example /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/femto.

Now browse to one of the index directories!

== RUNNING ==
Run the httpd server as usual. For testing, we use
 httpd -X

== USING ==
If you've installed the visualization tool, point Chrome or Firefox at
http://server/femto/your_index_name/ and everything should work!

You can also use wget or curl to interact with the FEMTO server. For example,
to find the start and end rows beginning with aa in the index, use:
 wget http://server/femto/your_index_name/ --post-data='string_rows 97 97' -O -
or
 curl http://server/femto/your_index_name/ --data 'string_rows 97 97'
