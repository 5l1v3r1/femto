The BWT format -

4-bytes BWT_START
4-bytes BWT_VERSION
8-bytes number-of-characters
8-bytes number-of-documents
8-bytes alphabet_size
8-bytes mark period
1-byte alphabet_size_bits
1-byte offset_size_bits
A sequence of RLE entries:
  alphabet_size_bits bits of character
  1 followed by offset_size_bits of logical offset
  - or - 
  0 followed by gamma-code # zeros


The auxillary document-map format
4-bytes DOC_MAP_START
4-bytes DOC_MAP_VERSION
8-bytes number-of-characters
8-bytes number-of-documents
8-bytes chunk-size
8-bytes number-of-chunks
A sequence of chunks.
  For each chunk (chunk-size parts):
    [byte aligment] 
    chunk_size_num_bits of # unique docs in this chunk
    delta/gamma coded document numbers
  [byte alignment]
  chunk_size_num_bits of 0


The auxillary document-info format:
4-bytes DOC_INFO_START
4-bytes DOC_INFO_VERSION
8-bytes number-of-characters
8-bytes number-of-documents
number-of-documents 8-byte document ends (including ssort-added EOFs) for logical offset
number-of-documents+1 8-byte offsets
at each offset, until the next offset, is the document info.
